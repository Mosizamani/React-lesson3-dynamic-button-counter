1- create a button component with two props (text and callback) that displays the text on the button and calls the call back when pressed!

2- use useState, useEffect and setInterval in App.jsx to render the button component with a new prop every second(you could show the current time in seconds or a random number or sth else!

3- use the callback function to pass the current value of the text prop back to the parent when the button is clicked, save this value in another state variable within App.jsx

4- add another prop to your button that allows you to set how much the counter increments on every tick
